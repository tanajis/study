      create lambda --> add environment variable  as password and give values
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import json
import os

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # TODO implement
    
    
    #read environment

      click on encryption configuration -->Enable encryption in transit-->select your KMS key name i both.
      Now go to your env variable and click on Encrypt.  Copy code Snippet to decrep to notepad
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Error :
      
  "errorMessage": "An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the Decrypt operation: The ciphertext refers to a customer master key that does not exist, does not exist in this region, or you are not allowed to access.",
  
  It means you DONT HAVE GIVEN KMS access to role of your lamba. Go to IAM and give permissions.

        IAM-->role-->add inline policies-->kms all
        
        or Create policy name it &save and then attach to your lambda role
